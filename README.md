## Backend API

This section goes trough the REST api that is used to communicate to the backend server.

Note many paths require you to set the authorization header, when missing the server would respond with 404 to avoid leakage of data

### Authentication users TODO

To authenticate a user send a request to `POST example.org/users/auth/{USERNAME}`
with the body `pswd={PSWD}`.
This would return a token that could be used for authenticating the user

### Listing users

Calling ``GET http://example.org/users`` returns the public info off all users.
Note this query might be slow

```curl
> GET /users HTTP/1.1
> Host: example.org
> User-Agent: curl/7.81.0
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *

[
    {
        "Id": 1,
        "Name": "myUser"
    },
    {
        "Id": 2,
        "Name": "SEAL_MAN"
    }
]
```

### Add a user

To add an user use the ``POST http://example.org/user``.
The body of this request, should contain name and pswd.
Note that the max length of both pswd and name is 45 bytes

```curl
> POST /user HTTP/1.1
> Host: example.org
> User-Agent: curl/7.81.0
> Accept: */*
> Content-Length: 23
> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
>
pswd=4321&name=test1234
